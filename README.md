# Coffee Share Application

##### ReactJS, MongoDB, Mongoose, ExpressJS, Google Maps API, HTML/CSS, React Router DOM, Mongo Atlas

##### JavaScript File System, Body Parser, Axios, bcryptJS, MUlter, jsonwebtoken, nodemon, Heroku

##### Live Deployment on Heroku: https://coffee-share.herokuapp.com/

Note on Live Deployment, Heroku doesn't keep images over time if stored in Local Storage. Working on an AWS deployment that will solve this problem.

### Summary

This application is meant as a way to share the Latte Art or Coffee you had that is worth sharing with others. You can add the address of where you got it and Google Maps API's 'GEOMETRY' function will then convert it into coordinates and save it into MongoDB/Mongo Atlas/Mongoose. Users will be able to see where others have had good coffee. The user an also upload a photo onto the app to show the coffee they got. The application includes authentication using a token system and password encryption.
